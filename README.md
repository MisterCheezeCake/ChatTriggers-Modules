# ChatTriggers-Modules
Code for most of my ChatTriggers modules

## Licensing

Most modules in this repository are licensed under the CCT, short for Cheeze ChatTriggers, license, which I wrote myself to fit what I want to be done with my code, and to be specific to the specific needs of Minecraft mods, such as EULA compliance.

However, due to some particular reasons, certain modules are licensed under different licenses, these are: SkyBlockKeybinds, WarpConfirm, CalcPowder, and Toasty. SBK, WarpConfirm, and CalcPowder are licensed under the GNU GPL v3, while Toasty is under the GNU AGPL v3.
